                    CTFN readers have access to a range of resources on our platform to enhance their research
                    resources:</p>
                <ul class="ml-5">
                    <li>DMA Alerts – Realtime alerts of all Definitive Merger Agreements, as they are filed at the SEC.
                        The
                        Pressrisk platform also applies an algorithm that extracts relevant details and clauses so our
                        readers
                        can have a quick summary of the filing. Pressrisk assigns a score to each agreement, indicating
                        its
                        likelihood of being held up in Chancery court.</li>
                    <li>Regulatory Calendar – Upcoming events, deadlines, decisions expected on critical deals, and
                        regulatory transactions. This calendar is populated by the CTFN analyst team in conjunction with
                        their deal research.</li>
                    <li>Active Situations – A list of the current deals that CTFN is covering and a simplified way to
                        gather
                        news, calendar items, court transcripts, filings, releases, and announcements, by deal, in one
                        centralized location. Subscribers who also use the RMS inbox can integrate their own email
                        subscriptions into the search.</li>
                    <li>Filings – Links to all filings and resources referenced in our news content and the Daily
